### ⚠️ Note on Hosting

> This project uses the **free hosting versions of Render (for backend)** and **Vercel (for frontend)**. Due to cold start times and limited server resources:
>
> - During login, you may experience **delays or temporary failures** in loading the dashboard, even after entering the correct credentials.
> - If this happens, **please try logging in 2–3 times**—the server will eventually respond once it wakes up.
